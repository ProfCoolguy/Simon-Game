# Simon Game

## Overview
This is a web-based Simon game implementation created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Simon is a classic memory game where players have to repeat a sequence of colors and sounds that the game produces.

## Features
- **Simple Interface**: Clean and intuitive user interface for easy gameplay.
- **Sound Feedback**: Engaging sound effects accompany each button press and sequence playback.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: The game progressively increases the length of the sequence, challenging players to remember more.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the game elements.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for game mechanics, user interaction, and score tracking.

## How to Play
1. Start the game by pressing the any button on the keyboard.
2. Watch and listen as the game plays a sequence of colors and sounds.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the colored buttons in the same order.
4. If you repeat the sequence correctly, the game will add another step to the sequence.
5. Continue playing and try to beat your high score!
